# Topic-Modelling
Topic modelling for Mast cell related articles
Initially the topic modelling was performed on abstracts of medical articles and papers published in the Pubmed domain. However, the data was extremely diverse to capture in selective topics. Also, the frequently occurring words were ‘mast’ and ‘cell’. And the model failed to perform to its full potential. And hence, the next set of input data were collected to train the model appropriately. Around 50 full text documents from Pubmed domain were gathered on ten different themes in relation to mast cells like ‘Anaphylaxis’, ‘Asthma’, ‘food allergy’, ‘Atherosclerosis’, ‘Dogs’, ‘Kidney’, ‘Pregnancy’, ‘Teeth’, ‘Paediatric’, and ‘Urticaria’. The text imported from these documents, which are in the form of PDFs, formed the input to the topic modelling algorithm, LDA.
